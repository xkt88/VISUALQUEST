    "    - no matter from which source, the visual pun should be able to recognised by at least one person (let's say from 30 candidates)\n",
    "    - In default case , each image should provide enough cue about the type of information expected, telling whether the image is related to a word? phrase? idiom? proverb? slang? celebrity? movie? famous character?\n",

    "<b>Exploring Distraction in LLMs Through Image Recognition</b>\n",
    "- If we select a set of images that a language model (LLM) correctly identifies when analyzed individually, and then feed these same images into the model simultaneously, the original correct classifications often turn incorrect. This phenomenon could provide a way to quantify and study the model's susceptibility to distraction or its ability to manage attention.\n",
    "- A key variable to investigate is the number of images. At what point does this phenomenon begin to appear? Is there a maximum number of images beyond which the accuracy stabilizes, regardless of how many additional images are introduced?\n",
    "- Another important factor is whether the order of the images in the prompt impacts the results. For example, does the first image receive more attention or priority compared to subsequent ones?\n",
    "- To gain further insight, we could compare different LLMs. For fairness, the comparison should only involve images that each model has correctly identified when evaluated individually.\n",
    "- Additionally, it would be interesting to explore an alternative approach: instead of feeding the images separately in a single prompt, what if the images are merged into a single composite image? Would this reduce distraction and improve recognition accuracy, or would it exacerbate the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers a compelling framework to study the distraction factor in LLMs. While this idea serves as a starting point, a deeper and more sophisticated investigation could form the basis of a detailed research paper."
